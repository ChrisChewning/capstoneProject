This project was created with React and Firebase and styled through Materialize.

## The Idea
For my final project for General Assembly, I wanted to incorporate my background as a public school teacher and make something that was useful and scaleable. Moving forward, I want to build on the to-do notes, notepad, and calculator. Some ideas are: flashcards, dictionary and 'this day in history' widgets, and a science component of some sort.


## The Hurdles
My main hurdles in this project were:

1. Working with the database. My goal was to streamline authentication through Google sign up. I tested it through two different Gmail addresses and could see the user info, uid, and all the data that gets created when you log in for the first time. Even the docs said you could create a user through logging in and skipping a 'create user' sign up. However, I didn't realize you had to create a users node in the database to attach data too.

2. Integrating a full-scale calendar. I settled for linking to the user's Google Calendar but wanted to have accessibility directly in the UI.

3. Working with APIs and time constraints. There is A LOT I want to do with this app and it feels like a first step. However, with the end of the program and into job hunting I couldn't build it out the way I wanted to.

## The Learning
I learned so much on this project. I love the setup of Firebase and using their event listener in the code as well as using their console. Many things such as passing props and how to use your app.js file more dynamically and interacting with your database (setting up your rules, for example) were all things I grew as a developer from.
